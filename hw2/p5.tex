    \begin{question}{5 (15') (Coupon Collector)}
    Farmer John is deploying sprinklers in a square field with side length $1$. Each sprinkler has a cover radius of $r\ (r < 1)$, meaning that all crops within distance $r$ of the sprinkler can be watered. The sprinklers are dropped independently and uniformly in the square field at random. Farmer John wants to know how many sprinklers are needed to ensure that the whole area of the field is covered with probability at least $(1 - \epsilon)$. Let $m$ be the minimum number of sprinklers required. Prove that,
    \[ m = \order{\frac{1}{r^2} \log{\frac{1}{\epsilon r^2}}}. \]

    \textit{[Hint: To show the required bound you only need a weak coupon collector bound; the result can be made stronger. In your solution, prove the coupon collector bound you use.]}
