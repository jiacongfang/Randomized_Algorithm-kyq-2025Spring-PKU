\begin{question}{5 (20') (Checking Commutativity)}
	Let $G$ be a finite group. In this question we want to check if $G$ is abelian, i.e., whether
	$$
	x\circ y=y\circ x
	$$
	holds for all $x,y\in G$. We assume $G$ is presented as a set of \textit{generators} $\{g_1,g_2,\cdots,g_k\}$ (i.e., every element of $G$ can be written as a product of various $g_i$) together with a black box which returns any desired product $g_i\circ g_j$ in unit time.
	
	There is a randomized algorithm making use of a \textit{random product} $h=g_1^{b_1}\circ g_2^{b_2}\circ\cdots\circ g_k^{b_k}$, where $b_i\in\{0,1\}$ are independent fair coin flips. It runs as follows
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let $h,h'$ be two independent \textit{random products}.
		\item If $h\circ h'\neq h'\circ h$, then output ``not abelian''; otherwise output ``abelian''.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Plainly this algorithm runs in $O(k)$ time, and is always correct when $G$ is abelian. Here are the questions.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[a. (10')] Suppose $H$ is any \textit{proper} subgroup of $G$. For a random product $h$, show that 
		$$
		\Pr[h\notin H]\geq\frac{1}{2}.
		$$
		\textit{[Hint: Construct $h'\notin H$ from any $h\in H$. ]}
		
		\item[b. (10')] Show that when $G$ is not abelian, the algorithm reports a correct answer with probability at least $1/4$. 
		
		\textit{[Hint: Consider the elements of $G$ that commute with all elements of $G$.]}
	\end{itemize}
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*).]
		\item $H < G$ implies that there exists $a \in G$ such that $a \notin H$. Therefore, for any random $h \in H$, $h \circ a \notin H$. And for any $h_1, h_2 \in H, h_1\neq h_2$, it's easy to verify that $h_1\circ a \neq h_2\circ a$. 
		Then for any random product $h$, we have 
		\begin{align*}
			1 = \Pr[h\in H] + \Pr[h\notin H] \le 2\Pr[h\notin H] \implies \Pr[h\notin H] \ge \frac{1}{2}.
		\end{align*}
		\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}
